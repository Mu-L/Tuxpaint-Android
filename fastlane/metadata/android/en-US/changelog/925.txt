  * New Features
    ------------
    * Export drawings:
      * GIF export option from the Open -> Slideshow dialog.
        (Closes https://sourceforge.net/p/tuxpaint/feature-requests/191/)
        * Utilizes "gifenc", public domain by Marcel Rodrigues:
          https://github.com/lecram/gifenc
        * Depends on "libimagequant", from the "pngquant2" project:
          https://github.com/ImageOptim/libimagequant
          (GPL v3 or later, for Free/Libre Open Source Software)
          (h/t TOYAMA Shin-ichi for adding support for versions < 2.8.0)
      * Single image (PNG) export from the Open dialog.
        (Closes https://sourceforge.net/p/tuxpaint/feature-requests/192/)
      * Both utilize XDG user dirs settings, if available, to determine
        where to store them, or "~/Pictures", otherwise.  In those cases,
        files are stored in a new "TuxPaint" subdirectory.
      * The "--exportdir" option can be used to override the default
        location (but a "TuxPaint" subdir. will NOT be placed there).

    * Shape controls:
      * Draw shapes from the center (as in previous versions of Tux Paint)
        or from a corner (similar to the default mode of most other
        graphics tools).
      * The controls to modify the drawing behavior can be removed,
        for simplification of Tux Paint's interface (for younger users).

  * Other Improvements
    ------------------
    * New, smaller sizes available in "Eraser" tool.
      (h/t Jackson Bray for the suggestion)

    * "Eraser" tool now draws smoothly connected strokes,
      like the "Brush" tool, when the mouse is moved quickly
      (relative to the eraser size; especially useful for the
      smallest erasers).

    * On-screen keyboard (visible when the feature is enabled, while
      using the "Text" and "Label" tools) now appears with larger
      (48x48 pixel, vs 24x24 pixel) buttons, when Tux Paint's window
      (or fullscreen) size is large enough to fit them with the
      chosen layout.
      (h/t Anat & Aviv, who suggested it to help with users of
      eye-tracking systems)

    * On-screen keyboard buttons use a slightly larger font
      (16pt vs 12pt, previously seen on the small keyboard;
      32pt on the large keyboard).

  * Starter & Template updates
    --------------------------

      empty string, rather than a NULL.

    * Mended bug where corrupt text would appear as stamp
      descriptions, if we failed to know what language to use
      (see above).
