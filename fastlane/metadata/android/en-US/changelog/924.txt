  * New tools
    ---------
    * Fill
      Not actually a new tool, but promoted from a "Magic" tool
      to a full-fledge tool in the "Tools" bar.  However, also
      avoids filling "Undo" buffer with snapshots of the drawing,
      if the fill does nothing (e.g., if you click the same spot
      a second time).

  * Other Improvements
    ------------------
    * Added ability to move color palette options to the end of
      the New dialog, for situations where users are meant to start
      drawings with specific Starters or Templates.
      Use "--newcolorslast" option.
      (Suggested by Bernard Verhaeghe)

    * Recognize signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) on POSIX systems,
      which causes Tux Paint to quit, first saving the current drawing
      (if unsaved) (like "--autosave"), either saving a new image
      (like "--saveovernew") (via SIGUSR1), or overwritting the current
      drawing (like "--saveover") (via SIGUSR2).
      (Thanks to Flavio Airundo for the idea; closes

    * Updated most parts of the code that were throwing warnings in GCC.

    * Build process generates thumbnails of included Starters and Templates.
      When installed, this greatly increases the speed of the "New" dialog.

    * Updated some Starter source images so they work better with
      flood fill (Bald Eagle, World map, Gecko).

    * Ability to disable stereo panning effect (e.g., paint brush, UI
      elements sound effect feedback, etc.), useful for users with
      hearing impairment in one ear, or situations where one speaker or
      headphone is being used.  Use "--nostereo" command-line option
      or "nostereo=yes" config. file option.

    * Various bugfixes.

  * Android port
    ------------
    * Updated SDL and SDL_Image libraries.

    * SVG Starters now open throught nanosvg included in SDL_Image.
