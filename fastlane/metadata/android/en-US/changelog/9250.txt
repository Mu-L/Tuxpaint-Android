Changes from 0.9.25 that affects mainly Android >= 10:

Set target sdk version to 28 to trigger automatic legacy storage in gradle.build
Explicit set legacy storage in AndroidManifest.xml in case the previous action
was not enough.
Using legacy storage is just a temporary solution as more sooner than lather 
Android apps will have to use Storage Access Framework to deal with files.

Solve "magic tools not appearing for restricted users" by setting the path to 
the "lib" directori based on current running path.
