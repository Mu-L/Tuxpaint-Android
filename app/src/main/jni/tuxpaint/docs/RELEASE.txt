Release checklist for Tux Paint

Last updated 2025-02-16

During development
------------------

Make sure any new options are documented in the "OPTIONS" docs
(now maintained in the "tuxpaint-docs" repository; see below),
the manpage (see below), and listed in the shell completion file
(src/tuxpaint-completion.bash), the "tuxpaint --help" output,
and the "Command-Line Options" section of the "OPTIONS" docs,
as appropriate.  Generally, new options should be exposed by
"Tux Paint Config." (in the "tuxpaint-config" repository),
and documented in its README, as well.

Make sure new features are recorded in "docs/CHANGES.txt", the
"What's New" section at the top of the current version's "README"
docs (now maintained in the "tuxpaint-docs" repository), and
in Tux Paint's appdata file (which is generated, with translated
text from PO files, based on "org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint.appdata.xml.in").

When appropriate, they can be added to the "Features" page of
the website (maintained in the "tuxpaint-website" repository).


Preparing
---------

Do these things _prior_ to cutting a release -- that is, prior to
tagging in the source code repository, running "make release" to roll
a .tar.gz source tarball, and making the tarball available for download.

 * Update version # and release dates

   Places to make sure version # and release date gets updated,

   * Makefile

   * Build description files:
     * tuxpaint.spec (Linux RPM package)
     * win32/resources.rc (Windows mingw/msys build)

   * Changelog
     * docs/CHANGES.txt

   * Metainfo file: (add entry for new version's changes)
     * src/org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint.appdata.xml.in

   * Other Documentation

     NOTE: As of Tux Paint 0.9.26, most of the documentation
     is now maintained in a separate source-code repository,
     "tuxpaint-docs".  Updates should be made there, and
     then copied over to the "tuxpaint" repository.

     No matter what else might need to happen, these always need updating
     ahead of a new release:

     * Update version number in doc-src/include.php
     * Update What's New section in doc-src/README/README-whatsnew.php
       (things worth mentioning in the press release on the website)

     There, run "make" to generate the HTML (and some other) files based
     on the PHP sources.  Then run "./copy-html-to-tuxpaint.sh" to copy
     the resulting files to the directory containing a checkout of the
     "tuxpaint" repo.

     Here, be sure to run "make" in "docs/", to produce plaintext
     alternatives of the docs that are available as HTML.
     e.g. (for English):

     * docs/en/html/ADVANCED-STAMPS-HOWTO.html
     * docs/en/html/ENVARS.html
     * docs/en/html/EXTENDING.html
     * docs/en/html/FAQ.html
     * docs/en/html/INSTALL.html
     * docs/en/html/OPTIONS.html
     * docs/en/html/PNG.html
     * docs/en/html/README.html
     * docs/en/html/SIGNALS.html
     * docs/en/html/SVG.html

     And also run "make" in "magic/magic-docs/", to produce plaintext
     alternatives for the various magic tools.

   * Manual page (manpage)

     NOTE: Also maintained in "tuxpaint-docs" now; see above.

     * man/tuxpaint.1

 * Rebuild 'tuxpaint.desktop' by running "update-po.sh" in "src/po/"

 * Rebuild "data/brushes/*.txt" by running "createtxt.sh" in "brushes-po/"

 * Don't forget to commit the changes!  (git add ... / git commit / git push)


Time to release:
----------------

 * Tag & roll a release tarball (example here was from 0.9.25):

   $ git pull
   $ make clean
   $ git tag tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27
   $ git push origin tuxpaint-0_9_25-2020-12-27 # or --tags
   $ make release

   * About release candidates (beta versions):

     Prior to a final release, we typically make
     "release candidates" (rc) for the purpose of both
     (a) having port maintainers exercise their build development,
     and report back any problems -- once mended, additional "rc"s
     can be rolled; and (b) providing beta builds for end-users
     to try out (with the understanding that things may be
     unstable).

     Set the `VER_VERSION` in the Makefile to denote the release
     candidate (e.g., "0.9.34-rc1").  Commit, and follow the steps
     above for making a release.  Use a tag includes mentions the
     release candidate, e.g. "tuxpaint-0_9_34-rc1-2024-10-16".

 * Upload each project's ".tar.gz" file from their "build/" subdirs
   to ftp.tuxpaint.org.

 * Place them in the appropriate subdirectories (source/, config/,
   and stamps/) under "unix/x/tuxpaint/".

 * Copy "docs/CHANGES.txt" from each project onto the FTP site
   (Tux Paint's goes in the toplevel, the others go in config/ and
   stamps/).

 * Create a new PAD file (e.g. `pads/tuxpaint-0.9.25.xml`) on the
   FTP site.

 * Replace the "pads/tuxpaint-LATEST.xml" symlink on the FTP site with
   a new one that points to the new PAD file.

 * At SourceForge, go to "Files" and use "Add Folder" under each project
   to create new release file subdirectories.  (e.g., "0.9.25" under
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxpaint/files/tuxpaint/)
   [Or, you can just use `mkdir` command in the `sftp` client, below.]

 * Upload the files!  Either from local copies, via a web browser,
   or by SCP, Rsync, or SFTP (see
   https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Release%20Files%20for%20Download/#scp)

   e.g.:

     $ sftp wkendrick@frs.sourceforge.net
     sftp> cd /home/frs/project/tuxpaint/

     sftp> cd tuxpaint/0.9.25/
     sftp> lcd source
     sftp> put tuxpaint-0.9.25.tar.gz

     sftp> cd ../..
     sftp> lcd ..

   [repeat for tuxpaint-config and tuxpaint-stamps]

 * Copy latest release's documentation to the tuxpaint.org website.

 * Create a new milestone, representing the new version,
   at Tux Paint's SourceForge project's bug tracker
   (https://sourceforge.net/p/tuxpaint/bugs/milestones)

   + Set it as the default.
   + Consider closing earlier milestone(s).

Website updates
---------------
 * Link to the downloads on the various pages under
   https://tuxpaint.org/download/
   + If a release candidate, post to the "beta" pages and
     link to them, and activate the main
     https://tuxpaint.org/beta/ page, too
   + If a final release, shut off the "beta" pages, if any
     are active
   + For some 3rd party software repositories
     (e.g. Flathub for Linux Flatpak, Haiku Depot, etc.),
     you will need to pay attention to when the new release
     lands, over the coming days/weeks.

 * List new features on https://tuxpaint.org/features/

 * Add any new requirements to https://tuxpaint.org/requirements/

 * Create a press release under https://tuxpaint.org/latest/

 * Copy the docs from the release (README, FAQ, etc.) onto the
   website so users can find it online at https://tuxpaint.org/docs/
   (use the `sync_docs.sh` script)
