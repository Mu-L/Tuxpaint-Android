      <h2>
        A. What Is "Tux Paint"?      </h2>
    <header>

    <p>
      Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide children as they use the program. It provides a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.    </p>

    <dl>
      <div class="keeptogether">
        <dt>
          <strong>Easy and Fun</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children. It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool. It <em>is</em> meant to be fun and easy to use. Sound effects and a cartoon character help let the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained. There are also extra-large cartoon-style mouse pointer shapes.        </dd>
      </div>

      <div class="keeptogether">
        <dt>
          <strong>Extensibility</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is extensible. Brushes and 'rubber stamp' shapes can be dropped in and pulled out. For example, a teacher can drop in a collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an ecosystem. Each shape can have a sound which is played, and textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.        </dd>
      </div>

      <div class="keeptogether">
        <dt>
          <strong>Portability</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint is portable among various computer platforms: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc. The interface looks the same among them all. Tux Paint runs suitably well on older systems, and can be built to run better on slow systems.        </dd>
      </div>

      <div class="keeptogether">
        <dt>
          <strong>Simplicity</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies. The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when it is restarted. Saving images requires no need to create filenames or use the keyboard. Opening an image is done by selecting it from a collection of thumbnails. Access to other files on the computer is restricted.        </dd>
      </div>

      <div class="keeptogether">
        <dt>
          <strong>Accessibility</strong>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          Tux Paint offers a number of accessibility options, including increasing the size of control buttons, changing the UI font, options to control the cursor (mouse pointer) using the keyboard or other input devices (joystick, gamepad, etc.), an on-screen keyboard, and "stick" mouse clicks.        </dd>

    <p>
      If you installed Tux Paint on your computer using the 'Tux Paint Installer,' it will have asked you whether you wanted a 'Start' menu short-cut, and/or a desktop shortcut. If you agreed, you can simply run Tux Paint from the 'Tux Paint' section of your 'Start' menu (e.g., under 'All Programs'), or by double-clicking the 'Tux Paint' icon on your desktop, if you had the installer place one there.    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using the 'portable' (ZIP-file) version of Tux Paint, or if you used the 'Tux Paint Installer,' but chose not to have shortcuts installed, you'll need to double-click the "<code>tuxpaint.exe</code>" icon in the "<code>Tux Paint</code>" folder on your computer.    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the 'Tux Paint Installer' will put Tux Paint's folder in "<code>C:\Program Files\</code>", though you may have changed this when you ran the installer.    </p>

    <p>
      If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux Paint's folder will be wherever you extracted the contents of the ZIP file.    </p>

              <strong>Color Picker</strong><br/>
              The "color picker" (which has an outline of an eye-dropper) allows you to pick a color found within your drawing.<br/>
              (A shortcut key is available to access this feature quickly; see below.)            </li>

              The rainbow palette allows you to pick any color by choosing the hue, saturation, and value of the color you want.

    The Paint Brush tool lets you draw freehand, using various brushes (chosen in the Selector on the right) and colors (chosen in the Color palette towards the bottom).  </p>

  <p>
    If you hold the mouse button down, and move the mouse, it will draw as you move.  </p>

  <p>
    Some brushes are animated &mdash; they change their shape as you draw them.  A good example of this is the vines brush that ships with Tux Paint.  These brushes will have a small "filmstrip" icon drawn on their Selector buttons.  </p>

  <p>
    Other brushes are directional &mdash; they will draw a different shape depending on what direction you are painting with them.  An example of this is the arrow brush that ships with Tux Paint.  These brushes have a small 8-way arrow icon drawn on their Selector buttons.  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, some brushes can be both direction <em>and</em> animated.  Examples of this are the cat and squirrel brushes that ship with Tux Paint.  These brushes will have both the "filmstrip" and 8-way arrow icons.  </p>

  <p>
    As you draw, a sound is played. The bigger the brush, the lower the pitch.  </p>

  <strong id="brush_spacing">Brush Spacing</strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The space between each position where a brush is applied to the canvas can vary.  Some brushes (such as the footprints and flower) are spaced, by default, far enough apart that they don't overlap.  Other brushes (such as the basic circular ones) are spaced closely, so they make a continuous stroke.    </p>
    <p>
      The default spacing of brushes may be overridden using by clicking within the triangular-shaped series of bars at the bottom right; the larger the bar, the wider the spacing. Brush spacing affects both tools that use the brushes: the "Paint" tool and the "Lines" tool.    </p>

    This tool lets you draw straight lines using the various brushes and colors you normally use with the Paint Brush.  </p>

  <p>
    Click the mouse and hold it to choose the starting point of the line. As you move the mouse around, a thin 'rubber-band' line will show where the line will be drawn. At the bottom, you'll see the angle of your line, in degrees. A line going straight to the right is 0¬∞, a line going straight up is 90¬∞, a line going straight left is 180¬∞, a line going straight down is 270¬∞, and so on.  </p>

  <p>
    Let go of the mouse to complete the line. A "sproing!" sound will play.  </p>

    Some brushes are animated, and will show a pattern of shapes along the line.  Others are directional, and will show a different shape depending on the angle of the brush.  And finally some are both animated and directional.  See "Paint", above, to learn more.  </p>

  <p>
    Different brushes have different spacing, leaving either a series of individual shapes, or a continuous stroke of the brush shape. Brush spacing may be adjusted. See the <a href="#brush_spacing">brush spacing</a> section of the "Paint" tool, above, to learn more.  </p>

        The <strong>Text</strong> tool is the original text-entry tool in Tux Paint. Text entered using this tool can't be modified or moved later, since it becomes part of the drawing. However, because the text becomes part of the picture, it can be drawn over or modified using <strong>Magic</strong> tool effects (e.g., smudged, tinted, embossed, etc.)      </p>

      <p>
        When using the <strong>Label</strong> tool (which was added to Tux Paint in version 0.9.22), the text 'floats' over the image, and the details of the label (the text, the position of the label, the font choice and the color) get stored separately. This allows the label to be repositioned or edited later.      </p>

      <p>
        To edit a label, click the label selection button. All labels in the drawing will appear highlighted. Click one &mdash; or use the <strong><code>[Tab]</code></strong> key to cycle through all the labels, and the <strong><code>[Enter]</code></strong> or <strong><code>[Return]</code></strong> key to select one &mdash; and you may then edit the label. (Use they <strong><code>[Backspace]</code></strong> key to erase characters, and other keys to add text to the label; click in the canvas to reposition the label; click in the palette to change the color of the text in the label; etc.)      </p>

      <p>
        You may "apply" a label to the canvas, painting the text into the picture as if it had been added using the <strong>Text</strong> tool, by clicking the label application button. (This feature was added in Tux Paint version 0.9.28.) All labels in the drawing will appear highlighted, and you select one just as you do when selecting a label to edit. The chosen label will be removed, and the text will be added directly to the canvas.      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <span title="Configuration option">&#9881;</span>        The <strong>Label</strong> tool can be disabled (e.g., by selecting "Disable 'Label' Tool" in <em>Tux Paint Config.</em> or running <em>Tux Paint</em> with the "<code>nolabel</code>" option).      </p>

        Tux Paint allows inputting characters in different languages. Most Latin characters (<em>A</em>-<em>Z</em>, <em>√±</em>, <em>√®</em>, etc.) can by entered directly. Some languages require that Tux Paint be switched into an alternate input mode before entering, and some characters must be composed using numerous keypresses.      </p>

      <p>
        When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the languages that provide alternate input modes, a key is used to cycle through normal (Latin character) and locale-specific mode or modes.      </p>

      <p>
        Currently supported locales, the input methods available, and the key to toggle or cycle modes, are listed below.      </p>

    A number of eraser sizes are available, with both square and round shapes. Fuzzy-edged round shapes are also available.  </p>

        By default, Tux Paint only shows the printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the "<code>altprintcommand</code>"; e.g., "<code>kprinter</code>" instead of "<code>lpr</code>") if the <b><code>[Alt]</code></b> (or <b><code>[Option]</code></b>) key is held while clicking the 'Print' button.      </p>

      <p>
        However, this behavior can be changed. You can have the printer dialog always appear by using "<code>--altprintalways</code>" on the command-line, or "<code>altprint=always</code>" in Tux Paint's configuration file. Conversely, you can prevent the <b><code>[Alt]</code></b>/<b><code>[Option]</code></b> key from having any effect by using "<code>--altprintnever</code>", or "<code>altprint=never</code>".      </p>

              1. Using a Mouse or Trackball            </h3>
          </header>

          <p>
            Tux Paint's main mode of operation is via any device that appears to your operating system as a mouse, including standard mice, trackballs, and trackpads, as well as drawing tablets (usually operated with a stylus) and touch screens (operated with a finger and/or a stylus) (see <a href="#using_controlling_tablet">"Using a Tablet or Touchscreen"</a> below for more information).          </p>

          <p>
            For drawing and controlling Tux Paint, only a single mouse button is used &mdash; typically, on multi-button mice, this will the left mouse button, but this can usually be configured at the operating system level. By default, Tux Paint will ignore input from the other button(s). If a user attempts to use the other button(s), a pop-up dialog will eventually appear reminding them that only one button is recognized Tux Paint. However, you may configure Tux Paint to accept any button as input (see the <a href="OPTIONS.html#mouse_keyboard">Options</a> documentation).          </p>

          <section>
            <header>
              <h4>

            </header>
            <p>
              Many input devices offer a way to quickly scroll within applications &mdash; many mice have a scroll wheel, trackballs have scroll rings, and trackpads recognize certain "scroll" gestures (e.g., two-finger vertical motion, or vertical motion on the edge of the trackpad). Tux Paint supports scrolling input to allow quick scrolling through certain lists (e.g., Stamps, Magic tools, and the New and Open dialogs).            </p>

            <p>
              Tux Paint will also automatically scroll if you click and hold the mouse down on an scroll button &mdash; the "up" and "down" arrow buttons that appear above and below scrolling lists.            </p>

            </header>
            <p>
              Other devices that appear as a mouse can be used to control Tux Paint. For example:              <ul>
                <li>Head pointing/tracking devices</li>
                <li>Eye gaze trackers</li>

            </p>
  
            <p>
              Tux Paint offers a "sticky mouse click" accessibility setting, where a single click begins a click-and-drag operation, and a subsequent click ends it.  (See the <a href="OPTIONS.html#accessibility">Options</a> documentation.)            </p>

            As noted above, Tux Paint recognizes any device that appears as a mouse. This means drawing tablets and touchscreens may be used.

          <p>
            Tux Paint may be configured to recognize input from any game controller that appears to your operating system as a joystick.  That even includes modern game console controllers connected via USB or Bluetooth (e.g., <cite>Nintendo Switch</cite> or <cite>Microsoft Xbox</cite> game pads)!          </p>

            Numerous configuration options are available to best suit the device being used, and the user's needs. Analog input will be used for coarse movement, and digital "hat" input for fine movement. Buttons on the controller can be mapped to different Tux Paint controls (e.g., acting as the <b><code>[Escape]</code></b> key, switching to the Paint tool, invoking Undo and Redo operations, etc.).

      III. Loading Other Pictures into Tux Paint    </h1>

      <h2>
        A. Overview      </h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures you created with Tux Paint. So what do you do if you want to load some other drawinng or even a photograph into Tux Paint, so you can edit or draw on it?    </p>
  
    <p>
      You can simply convert the picture to the format Tux Paint uses &mdash; PNG (Portable Network Graphic) &mdash; and place it in Tux Paint's "<code>saved</code>" directory/folder. Here is where to find it (by default):    </p>
  
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong>Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista</strong>
      </dt>
  
      <dd>
        Inside the user's "<code>AppData</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\</code>".      </dd>
  
      <dt>
        <strong>Windows 2000, XP</strong>
      </dt>
  
      <dd>
        Inside the user's "<code>Application Data</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>username</em>\Application Data\TuxPaint\saved\</code>".      </dd>
  
      <dt>
        <strong>macOS</strong>
      </dt>
  
      <dd>
        Inside the user's "<code>Library</code>" folder, e.g.: "<code>/Users/<em>username</em>/Library/Application Support/Tux Paint/saved/</code>".      </dd>
  
      <dt>
        <strong>Linux/Unix</strong>
      </dt>
  
      <dd>
        Inside a hidden "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" directory, in the user's home directory ("<code>$HOME</code>"), e.g. "<code>/home/<em>username</em>/.tuxpaint/saved/</code>".      </dd>
    </dl>
  
    <p class="note">
      <span title="Information">&#128161;</span>      <strong>Note:</strong> It is also from this folder that you can copy or open pictures drawn in Tux Paint using <em>other</em> applications, though the 'Export' option from Tux Paint's 'Open' dialog can be used to copy them to a location that's easier and safer to access.    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="inner">
    <header>
      <h2>
        B.        Using the import script, "<code>tuxpaint-import</code>"      </h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Linux and Unix users can use the "<code>tuxpaint-import</code>" shell script which gets installed when you install Tux Paint. It uses some NetPBM tools to convert the image ("<code>anytopnm</code>"), resize it so that it will fit in Tux Paint's canvas ("<code>pnmscale</code>"), and convert it to a PNG ("<code>pnmtopng</code>").    </p>

    <p>
      It also uses the "<code>date</code>" command to get the current time and date, which is the file-naming convention Tux Paint uses for saved files. (Remember, you are never asked for a 'filename' when you go to save or open pictures!)    </p>

    <p>
      To use this script, simply run it from a command-line prompt, and provide it the name(s) of the file(s) you wish to convert.    </p>

    <p>
      They will be converted and placed in your Tux Paint "<code>saved</code>" directory.    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <span title="Information">&#128161;</span>      <strong>Note:</strong> If you're doing this for a different user (e.g., your child) you'll need to make sure to run the command under <em>their</em> account.)    </p>

    <p>
      Example:    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>$ <strong>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</strong><br>
      grandma.jpg -&gt;
      /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20211231012359.png<br>
      jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The first line ("<code>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</code>") is the command to run. The following two lines are output from the program while it's working.    </p>

    <p>
      Now you can load Tux Paint, and a version of that original picture will be available under the 'Open' dialog. Just double-click its icon!    </p>

        C.        Importing Pictures Manually      </h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Windows, macOS, and Haiku users who wish to import arbitrary images into Tux Paint must do so via a manual process.    </p>

    <p>
      Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading your picture and saving a PNG format file. (See the documentation file "<a href="PNG.html">PNG.html</a>" for a list of suggested software, and other references.)    </p>

    <p>
      When Tux Paint loads an image that's not the same size as its drawing canvas, it scales (and sometimes smears the edges of) the image so that it fits within the canvas.    </p>

    <p>
      To avoid having the image stretched or smeared, you can resize it to Tux Paint's canvas size. This size depends on the size of the Tux Paint window, or resolution at which Tux Paint is run, if in fullscreen. (<strong>Note:</strong> The default resolution is 800x600.) See "Calculating Image Dimensions", below.    </p>

      <p>
        Save the picture in PNG format. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you name the filename using the current date and time, since that's the convention Tux Paint uses:      </p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <code><strong>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</strong>.png</code>
      </blockquote>
  
      <ul>
        <li><code>YYYY</code> = Year</li>
        <li><code>MM</code> = Month (two digits, "01"-"12")</li>
        <li><code>DD</code> = Day of month (two digits, "01"-"31")</li>
        <li><code>HH</code> = Hour (two digits, in 24-hour format, "00"-"23")</li>
        <li><code>mm</code> = Minute (two digits, "00"-"59")</li>
        <li><code>ss</code> = Seconds (two digits, "00"-"59")</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>

        This part of the documentation needs to be rewritten, since the new "<code>buttonsize</code>" option was added.
