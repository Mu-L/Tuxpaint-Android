Rreth SVG-sh

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open standard used to describe
two-dimensional vector graphics. It is great for diagrams and shapes, while
PNGs are better for photographs. SVG files are a bit like instructions on how
to make an image. This means that they can be resized without looking pixelated
or blocky.

Si të krijoni SVG-ra

An excellent tool with which to create SVG images for use in Tux Paint is
Inkscape, a high-quality Open Source interactive drawing program available for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are also other applications that can produce
SVGs, both free/open source, and commerical/proprietary.
