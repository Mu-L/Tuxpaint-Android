        Fonts I added to Tux Paint only show squares      </dt>

      <dd>
        The TrueType Font you're using might have the wrong encoding. If it's 'custom' encoded, for example, you can try running it through FontForge (<a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/</a>) to convert it to an ISO-8859 format. (Email us if you need help with special fonts.)      </dd>

      <dt>
        The Rubber Stamp tool is greyed out!      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          This means that Tux Paint either couldn't find any stamp images, or was asked not to load them.        </p>

        <p>
          If you installed Tux Paint, but did not install the separate, optional "Stamps" collection, quit Tux Paint and install it now. It should be available from the same place you got the main Tux Paint program. <i>(Note: As of version 0.9.14, Tux Paint comes with a small collection of example stamps.)</i>        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't want to install the default collection of stamps, you can just create your own. See the "Extending Tux Paint" documentation for more on creating PNG and SVG image files, TXT text description files, Ogg Vorbis, MP3 or WAV sound files, and DAT text data files that make up stamps.        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, if you installed stamps, and think they should be loading, check to see that the "nostamps" option isn't being set. (Either via a "<code>--nostamps</code>" option to Tux Paint's command line, or "<code>nostamps=yes</code>" in the configuration file.)        </p>

        <p>
          Either change/remove the "nostamps" option, or you can override it with "<code>--stamps</code>" on the command line or either "<code>nostamps=no</code>" or "<code>stamps=yes</code>" in a configuration file.        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>
        Stamp outlines are always rectangles      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          Tux Paint was built with low-quality (but faster) stamp outlines.        </p>

        <p>
          To change this, you must rebuild Tux Paint from source. Be sure to remove or comment out any line that says:        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>

        <p>
          Tux Paint was probably compiled with the faster, lower quality thumbnail code enabled. Run the command: "<code>tuxpaint --verbose-version</code>" from a command line. If, amongst the other output, you see the text: "Low Quality Thumbnails enabled", then this is what's happening.        </p>

          The "uppercase" option is on.        </p>

           Either change/remove the "uppercase" option, or you can override it with "<code>--mixedcase</code>" on the command line or either "<code>uppercase=no</code>" or "<code>mixedcase=yes</code>" in a configuration file.      </dd>

        Tux Paint is in a different language      </dt>

        Make sure your locale setting is correct. See "Tux Paint won't switch to my language", below.      </dd>

            <i>Linux and Unix users: Make sure the locale is available</i>
            <p>
              Make sure the locale you want is available. Check your "/etc/locale.gen" file. See the "Options Documentation" for the locales Tux Paint uses (especially when using the "<code>--lang</code>" option).            </p>

            <p>
              Note: Debian and derivative (e.g., Ubuntu) users can simply run "<code>dpkg-reconfigure locales</code>" if the locales are managed by "dpkg".            </p>
          </li>

          <li>If you're using the "<code>--lang</code>" command-line option            <p>
              Try using the "<code>--locale</code>" command-line option, or your operating system's locale settings (e.g., the "<code>$LANG</code>" environment variable), and please e-mail us regarding your trouble.            </p>
          </li>

          <li>If you're using the "<code>--locale</code>" command-line option            <p>
              If this doesn't work, please e-mail us regarding your trouble.            </p>
          </li>

          <li>If you're trying to use your Operating System's locale            <p>
              If this doesn't work, please e-mail us regarding your trouble.            </p>
          </li>

          <li>Make sure you have the necessary font            <p>
              Some translations require their own font. Chinese and Korean, for example, need Chinese and Korean TrueType Fonts installed and placed in the proper location, respectively.            </p>

            <p>
              The appropriate fonts for such locales can be downloaded from the Tux Paint website:            </p>

      <dd>
        <p>
          Tux Paint prints by creating a PostScript rendition of the picture and sending it to an external command. By default, this command is the "<code>lpr</code>" printing tool.        </p>

        <p>
          If that program is not available (for example, you're using CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, and do not have "<code>cups-lpr</code>" installed), you will need to specify an appropriate command using the "<code>printcommand</code>" option in Tux Paint's configuration file. (See the "Options Documentation".)        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Note:</i> Versions of Tux Paint prior to 0.9.15 used a different default command for printing, "<code>pngtopnm | pnmtops | lpr</code>", as Tux Paint output PNG format, rather than PostScript.        </p>

        <p>
          If you had changed your "printcommand" option prior to Tux Paint 0.9.15, you will need to go back and alter it to accept PostScript.        </p>

          The "print delay" option is on. You can only print once every <i>X</i> seconds.        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're not giving it a "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" option.        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the properties of the icon to see if "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" is listed as a command-line argument.        </p>

        <p>
          If a "<code>--printdelay=...</code>" option isn't being sent on the command line, check Tux Paint's configuration file for a line reading: "<code>printdelay=...</code>".        </p>

        <p>
          Either remove that line, set the delay value to 0 (no delay), or decrease the delay to a value you prefer. (See the "Options Documentation".)        </p>

        <p>
          Or, you can simply run Tux Paint with the command-line argument: "<code>--printdelay=0</code>", which will override the configuration file's setting, and allow unlimited printing. (You won't have to wait between prints.)        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're not giving it a "<code>--noprint</code>" option.        </p>

        <p>
          If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the properties of the icon to see if "<code>--noprint</code>" is listed as a command-line argument.        </p>

        <p>
          If a "<code>--noprint</code>" option isn't being sent on the command line, check Tux Paint's configuration file for a line reading: "<code>noprint=yes</code>".        </p>

        <p>
          Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line argument: "<code>--print</code>", which will override the configuration file's setting.        </p>

              If sound seems to work otherwise (and you're sure no other program is "blocking" the sound device), then Tux Paint may be running with a "no sound" option.            </p>

            <p>
              If you're running Tux Paint from a command-line, make sure you're not giving it a "--nosound" option.            </p>

            <p>
              If you're running Tux Paint by double-clicking an icon, check the properties of the icon to see if "--nosound" is listed as a command-line argument.            </p>

            If a "<code>--nosound</code>" option isn't being sent on the command line, check Tux Paint's configuration file for a line reading: "<code>nosound=yes</code>".            </p>

            <p>
              Either remove that line, or simply run Tux Paint with the command-line argument: "<code>--sound</code>", which will override the configuration file's setting.            </p>

            <p>
              Or, you can simply run Tux Paint with the command-line argument: "Enable Sound Effects", which will override the configuration file's setting, and allow unlimited printing. (You won't have to wait between prints.)            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Were sounds temporarily disabled?</em>
            <p>
              Even if sounds are enabled in Tux Paint, it is possible to disable and re-enable them temporarily using the <b>[Alt]</b> + <b>[S]</b> key sequence. Try pressing those keys to see if sounds begin working again.            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Was Tux Paint built without sound support?</em>
            <p>
              Tux Paint may have been compiled with sound support disabled. To test whether sound support was enabled when Tux Paint was compiled, run Tux Paint from a command line, like so:            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <code>tuxpaint --verbose-version</code>
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              If, amongst the other information, you see "Sound disabled", then the version of Tux Paint you're running has sound disabled. Recompile Tux Paint, and be sure NOT to build the "nosound" target. (i.e., don't run "<code>make nosound</code>") Be sure the SDL_mixer library and its development headers are available!            </p>

        Tux Paint makes too much noise! Can I turn them off?      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
          Yes, there are a number of ways to disable sounds in Tux Paint:        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Press <b>[Alt]</b> + <b>[S]</b> while in Tux Paint to temporarily disable sounds. (Press that key sequence again to re-enable sounds.)          </li>

          <li>Run Tux Paint with the "no sound" option:            <ul>
              <li>Run "<code>tuxpaint --nosound</code>" from the command line or shortcut or desktop icon.              </li>

              <li>Edit Tux Paint's configuration file (see "Options Documentation" for details) and add a line containing "<code>nosound=yes</code>".              </li>

              <li>
                  Or use Tux Paint Config. and make sure "Enable Sound Effects" (under "Video &amp; Sound") is not checked.              </li>

              <li>
                  Alternatively, recompile Tux Paint with sound support disabled. (See above, and the 'Install' documentation.              </li>

          </li>

          Please e-mail us with details about your computer system. (Operating system and version, sound card, which version of Tux Paint you're running (run "<code>tuxpaint --version</code>" to verify), and so on.)        </p>

        <p>
          Linux users - Your X-Window server is probably not set with the ability to switch to the desired resolution: 800×600. (or whatever resolution you have Tux Paint set to run at.) (This is typically done manually under the X-Window server by pressing <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b><code>[Control]</code></b> + <b><code>[Alt]</code></b> + <b><code>[<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Keypad Plus (+)</span>]</code></b></span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><b><code>[Control]</code></b> + <b><code>[Alt]</code></b> + <b><code>[<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Keypad Minus (-)</span>]</code></b></span>.)        </p>

        <p>
          For this to work, your monitor must support that resolution, and you need to have it listed in your X server configuration.        </p>

        <p>
          Check the "Display" subsection of the "Screen" section of your XFree86 or X.org configuration file (typically "<code>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</code>" or "<code>/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>", depending on the version of XFree86 you're using; 3.x or 4.x, respectively, or "<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>" for X.org).        </p>

        <p>
          Add "<code>800x600</code>" (or whatever resolution(s) you want) to the appropriate "Modes" line. (e.g., in the "Display" subsection that contains 24-bit color depth ("Depth 24"), which is what Tux Paint tries to use.)        </p>

        <blockquote>

          If Tux Paint aborts with the message: "You're already running a copy of Tux Paint!", this means it has been launched in the last 30 seconds. (On Unix/Linux, this message would appear in a terminal console if you ran Tux Paint from a command-line. On Windows, this message would appear in a file named "<code>stdout.txt</code>" in the same folder where <code>TuxPaint.exe</code> resides (e.g., in <nobr>"<code style='background: #EEE;'>C:\Program Files\TuxPaint\</code>"</nobr>).        </p>

        <p>
          Even if the lockfile exists, it contains the 'time' Tux Paint was last run. If it's been more than 30 seconds, Tux Paint should run fine, and simply update the lockfile with the current time.        </p>

        <p>
          If multiple users are sharing the directory where this file is stored (e.g., on a shared network drive), then you'll need to disable this feature.        </p>

        <p>
          To disable the lockfile, add the "<code>--nolockfile</code>" argument to Tux Paint's command-line, or "<code>nolockfile=yes</code>" to the configuration file.        </p>

      <dd>
        <p>
          The first time Tux Paint is launched (for a particular user), it may take a minute or more to respond. The font system used by Tux Paint (FontConfig, via Pango) is creating a 'cache' of information about the fonts on your system. Subsequent launches of Tux Paint should be fast.        </p>

        <p>
          While the font cache is generated behind the scenes, Tux Paint should remain interactive (showing an animated 'please wait' animation) as this process runs.        </p>

        <p>
          If this delay persists or reoccurs, it could be that the cache is being deleted &mdash; for example, in an environment  (such as a school computer lab) where a system is returned into a default state when a user finishes using the program. Some versions of Tux Paint ship with a file, <nobr>"<code style='background: #EEE;'>fonts.conf</code>"</nobr> (<a href="https://fontconfig.pages.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html">documented at freedesktop.org</a>), which can be modified to have FontConfig store the file elsewhere, e.g.:          <blockquote>
