Questions
=========
For users, the following is a list of information you can send the
Tux Paint developers when opening a ticket at SourceForge.net or
emailing us for assistance.

Tux Paint project members, if someone has asked you for help, there is
information you can gather before passing it along to the developers
(in particular, those who help maintain the various ports of Tux Paint).

Windows
-------
 * The version of Windows (e.g., "Windows 11 Pro 22H2")
 * The version of Tux Paint (e.g., "0.9.28-3")
 * Type of the package used -- Installer EXE or Portable ZIP version
 * If Installer, Which installation type was selected while -- "All Users"
   or "Current User Only"
 * Send a copy of the config file, e.g. "tuxpaint.cfg" in
   C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\
 * Send any debugging output files, e.g., "stdout.txt" and "stderr.txt"
   in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\

 * A debug version of Tux Paint may be available that will
   record stderr & stdout into /tmp/tuxpaint.log; check with
   the developers to see if one is available.
   - /tmp is hidden in macOS, so the user will need to go to
