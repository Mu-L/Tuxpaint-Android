Click and drag to draw with 3-point perspective. Lines will only go towards
your three vanishing points, or aligned with the "horizon" defined by two of
the vanishing points. Use "3-Point Select" to choose your vanishing points
(only available in "advanced" mode). In "beginner" mode, two "3-Point Draw"
tools will be available, one with upwards-looking vanishing points, and one
with downwards-looking vanishing points.

This tool is operated in a freehand fashion.

This tool offers multiple size settings.

This tool offers color choices.

This tool is not available with "complexity" (expertise level) set to 'Novice'.
