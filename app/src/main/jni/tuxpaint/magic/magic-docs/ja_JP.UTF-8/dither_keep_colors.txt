This makes parts of your picture two colors: white, and colors based on your
original drawing, using a dithered pattern of dots that reflect the original
picture's shades; the darker the shade, the more non-white dots are drawn.

This tool offers both freehand and one-click operation.

This tool offers multiple size settings.
