#  First, the blacklist. We list font families that can crash Tux Paint
#  via bugs in the SDL_ttf library. We also test fonts to be sure that
#  they have both uppercase and lowercase letters. Note that we do not
#  test for "Aa", because it is OK if uppercase and lowercase are the
#  same (but not nice -- such fonts get a low score later).
#  We test the alphabet twice, to help with translation. If the users
#  will be unable to type ASCII letters, then both Line X and Line Y
#  should be translated. Otherwise, only Line X should be translated
#  and the ASCII-only fonts should be given bad scores in the scoring
#  code below (the best scores going to fonts that support both).

#. First, the blacklist. We list font families that can crash Tux Paint

#. they have both uppercase and lowercase letters. Note that we do not
#. test for "Aa", because it is OK if uppercase and lowercase are the
#. same (but not nice -- such fonts get a low score later).
#.
#. Most locales leave the blacklist strings alone: "QX" and "qx"
#. (it is less destructive to use the scoring strings instead)
#.
#. Locales that absolutely require all fonts to have some
#. extra characters should use "QX..." and "qx...", where "..."
#. are some characters you absolutely require in all fonts.
#.
#. Locales with absolutely NO use for ASCII may use "..." and "...",
#. where "..." are some characters you absolutely require in
#. all fonts. This would be the case for a locale in which it is
#. impossible for a user to type ASCII letters.
#.

#  Now we score fonts to ensure that the best ones will be placed at
#  the top of the list. The user will see them first. This sorting is
#  especially important for users who have scroll buttons disabled.
